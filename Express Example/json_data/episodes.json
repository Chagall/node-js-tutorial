    "description": "Season 1 of Showtime's horror drama series Penny Dreadful is eight episodes long, and introduces an unlikely cast of heroes battling an incursion of vampires in Victorian London.",
    "plot": "This series contains some of literature's most terrifying characters, Vanessa Ives (an enigmatic, composed, driven heroine who ignores zeitgeist and proves herself a force to be reckoned with.) and Sir Malcolm Murray (a hardened explorer of the African continent, on a deeply personal quest to find his kidnapped daughter Mina.) form a deeper bond as the group, including Ethan Chandler (a charming, brash, daring American man of action with uncanny marksmanship, who detests violence and is more complicated than he likes to admit.), Victor Frankenstein (an arrogant young man whose whole life revolves around his research.), and Sembene (a long-time ally of Sir Malcolm with a mysterious persona.), unite together to find Sir Malcolm Murray's missing daughter and banish the evil forces that threaten to destroy them. Meanwhile, Dorian Gray (a confident, entrancing, yet lonely, self-isolating man who cannot die.), the Creature (a reanimated corpse brought to life and abandoned by Frankenstein who tracks down his creator and demands that Frankenstein create a mate for him.) and Brona Croft (an Irish immigrant seeking to escape her brutal past.) hover on the periphery of the core group. Penny Dreadful is a frightening psychological thriller that weaves together these classic horror origin stories into a new adult drama.",

        "plot": "Vanessa, through a letter to Mina, relates their backstory. The Ives and Murray families were neighbors and friends, to the point where Vanessa and Mina were considered closer than sisters, and it was accepted as a foregone conclusion that Vanessa would marry Mina's frail brother Peter. As a young girl, Vanessa caught Malcolm and her mother having an affair. Although she kept it a secret, she says the experience led her to embrace her dark side, culminating in seducing Mina's fiancé the night before their wedding. The families severed ties after this, the strain of which caused Vanessa's clairvoyance and mediumship to manifest. She was committed to an asylum, an experience which left her mostly catatonic. Vanessa recovered with the assistance of an evil spirit that took Malcolm's form. Some time later, Vanessa encountered Mina, who forgave her for her transgression, but revealed that she had already been kidnapped by the master vampire. This inspired Vanessa to seek out Malcolm and begin their search."
